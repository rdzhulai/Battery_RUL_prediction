# Model Documentation

## 1. Overview

This documentation outlines the details of a linear regression model developed to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of NMC-LCO 18650 batteries based on features derived from their voltage and current behavior over multiple cycles. The dataset used for training and evaluation was obtained from the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute, comprising 14 batteries cycled 1000 times at 25Â°C with a CC-CV charge rate of C/2 and discharge rate of 1.5C. The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ignaciovinuales/battery-remaining-useful-life-rul?select=Battery_RUL.csv).

## 2. Motivation

The aim is to create a predictive model that can estimate the remaining useful life of batteries, providing insights into their degradation over cycles. This information is valuable for proactive maintenance and optimal utilization of battery systems.

## 3. Success Metrics

The success of the model is primarily evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as a performance metric, measuring the accuracy of the predicted RUL compared to the actual values.

## 4. Requirements & Constraints

### 4.1 What's in-scope & out-of-scope?

In-scope:
- Training a linear regression model for RUL prediction.
- Evaluation of model performance using RMSE.

Out-of-scope:
